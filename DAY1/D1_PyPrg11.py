# Initialize a variable for the countdown starting from 10

# Use a while loop to continuue as long as countdown_number is greater than 0
while countdown_number > 0:
    # Print the current number in the countdown
    print(countdown_number)
    # Decrenment the countdown_number by 1 in each iteration
    countdown_number -= 1 # This sis equivalent to countdown_number = 

# After the loop finishes (when countdown_number becomes 0 or less),
